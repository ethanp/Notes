### The Environment

Essentially the shell's *global state*, inherited by every child process of
this shell.

To change the environment for a *single command*, prefix the command with your
settings

    CLASSPATH=/bin:/usr/bin java MyProgram

### Variables

Assign a value to a variable

    my_var=24

Make an existing variable **read-only**

    readonly my_var

Add variable from this script to Bash's *global environment*

    export my_var

Print the environment

    env
    # or
    export -p

_Remove_ variable/function from the shell

    unset my_var
    unset -f my_fctn    # for functions

#### Expansion operators

| **Operator** | **Meaning** |
| ---------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${#my_var}`           | Return __number of characters__ in the value of `my_var`     |
| `${my_var:-default}`   | Return __default__ value if variable is undefined            |
| `${my_var:=default}`   | __Set__ variable *and* return it if it is undefined          |
| `${my_var:?"message"}` | If variable is *null* or *undefined*, __exit__ and print message |
| `${my_var:+value}`     | Return `value` if `my_var` *is* defined                  |
| `${variable#pattern}`  | Delete *shortest* match from *beginning* (only) of var's value, and return the rest (note: the `variable` itself is left unaltered) |
| `${variable##pattern}` | Delete *longest* match from *beginning*, return the rest |
| `${variable%pattern}`  | Delete *shortest* match from *end*, return the rest |
| `${variable%%pattern}` | Delete *longest* match from *end*, return the rest |

##### Examples
    vble=/my/long/path_to.thing
    echo ${vble#/*/} # => long/path_to.thing
    echo ${vble##/*/} # => path_to.thing

### Script/Function Parameters

#### Special variables

Try `echo`ing these.

| **Variable** | **Meaning**                                            |
| -----------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `$!`         | PID of the most recent background command              |
| `$$`         | PID of the (current) script file or bash terminal      |
| `$?`         | Most recent foreground pipeline **exit status**        |
| `$#`         | Number of arguments passed to shell script/function    |
| `$*`/`$@`    | All command-line arguments (no quoting applied)        |
| `"$*"`       | All command-line arguments as a *single* string        |
| `"$@"`       | All cmd-line args, each wrapped in quotes              |
| `:`          | Alias for `true`; deprecated                           |

#### Functions for manipulating parameters

Replace supplied positional parameters with your own set of parameters

    set first and third arguments

Shift all arguments *left*, replacing `$1` with `$2` and so on

    shift [#args to shift]

### Arithmetic

The shell evaluates the arithmetic expressions inside and places the result
back into the text of the command.

This is done as you'd expect, and it has *everything* you're used to, like
`|`, `||`, `<<`, `+=`, `++`, etc.

    echo $((2 + 3))    # => 5

**Booleans** are `1 = true` and `0 = false`

    echo $((2 && 3))   # => 1

**Exponentiation** is done with `**`, like in Python

    echo $((2 ** 3))   # => 8

__Note:__ `$((...))` is defined by POSIX and is therefore available in all
normal shells. KSH and BASH also have `((...))` and `let ...` but those should
probably not be used seeing as they make the code less portable.

### If

General form (based on Algol 68)

    if cond
    then
        # what to do
    elif cond
        # something
    else
        # otherwise
    fi

`test expr` is a synonym for `[ expr ]` (spaces required)

Test if `$file` is a directory

    if [ -d "$file" ]

String comparison

    if [ "$file" = "myfilename" ]

Multiple boolean checks

    if [ "$file" = "myfilename" ] || [ "$file" = "another/name" ]

### Case

* Check if a variable is one of many values.
* Patterns for catching the variable *can* contain wildcard characters.

Syntax

    case $1 in
    -f)
        # code
        ;;  # like "break"
    -d | --directory)  # multiple options
        # code
        ;;
    *)                 # catch-all (not required)
        ;;  # not required here
    esac

### Looping

#### For

    for i in *.[ch]
    do
        # something
    done

Loop over command-line arguments

    for i
    do
        case $1 in
        -f)
            # etc.
            ;;
        # etc.
        esac
    done

#### While and Until

    while condition
    do
        stuff   # *break* and *continue* are allowed
    done

    until condition
    do
        stuff
    done

**WARNING:** as noted in the [Google Bash styleguide][gbs], variables modified
in a while loop do not propagate to the parent because **a while loop's**
**commands run in a subshell**. The implicit subshell in a pipe to while can
make it difficult to track down bugs. The workaround is to 

```bash
last_line='NULL'
your_command | while read line; do
  last_line="${line}"
done

# This will output 'NULL'
echo "${last_line}"
```

[gbs]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml

Their first solution is to use for loop, but that is only possible if the input will *never* contain spaces or special characters (i.e. it is also not user input). 

Their second solution uses "process substitution" with redirected output

```bash
total=0
last_file=
while read count filename; do
  total+="${count}"
  last_file="${filename}"
done < <(your_command | uniq -c)

# This will output the second field of the last line of output from
# the command.
echo "Total = ${total}"
echo "Last one = ${last_file}"
```

But what the heck is that `<()` construct? The most succinct explanation comes
from this [redirections cheat sheet][rcs], which has _many_ useful
explanations, and states, and was written by that guy who is substack's friend

* `cmd <(cmd1)` -- redirect stdout of `cmd1` to an anonymous fifo, then pass
  the fifo to `cmd` as an argument. Useful when `cmd` doesnâ€™t read from `STDIN`
  directly.
* `cmd < <(cmd1)` -- redirect stdout of `cmd1` to an anonymous fifo, then
  redirect the fifo to `STDIN` of `cmd`.
*  `cmd <(cmd1) <(cmd2)` -- redirect `STDOUT` of `cmd1` and `cmd2` to two
   anonymous fifos, then pass both fifos as arguments to `cmd`. Best example:

        diff <(find /path1 | sort) <(find /path2 | sort).
* `cmd1 > >(cmd2)` -- run `cmd2` with its `STDIN` connected to an anonymous
  fifo, then redirect `STDOUT` of `cmd` to this anonymous pipe.

#### POSIX-Style Command-Line Arguments

Use `getopts` to allow getting CLAs like

    grep -vnf --long-one=24

Here's how you'd implement something like that

    file=
    verbose=
    quiet=
    long=

    while getopts "$@" opt
    do
        case $opt in
        f)
            file=$OPTARG
            ;;
        v)
            verbose=true
            quiet=
            ;;
        esac
    done

### Functions

    my_func() {
        my code
        return 2  # set exit-status to 2 (failing)
    }

Note that if you modify a global variable in a function, this modification is
actually modifying that variable for real.

### `$(c)` vs `backtick(c)` vs `eval c`

* `$(c)` and `backtick(c)` are (at least practically) the same, they **capture the output**.
* `eval c` **interprets the text** you give it as a bash command.

### Subshells and Code Blocks

**Subshell** commands are wrapped in parentheses and are run in a separate
process. The main advantage is that state changes in the subshell (e.g. via
`cd`) don't affect the parent.

    tar -cf - . | (cd /newdir; tar -xpf -)

A **code block** is like a subshell, but runs in the shell's current process,
and state changes *do* affect the shell's state. These don't seem all that
useful.

## Jobs

    $ vim

    # you type
    ^z  # stop (pause) process

    [1]+ Stopped    vim

    $ jobs
    [1]+ Stopped    vim

    $ fg  # back to vim
    ^z

    $ less somefile.txt
    ^z
    [2]+ Stopped    less somefile.txt

    $ jobs
    [1]- Stopped    vim
    [2]+ Stopped    less somefile.txt

    $ fg    # back to less
    ^z

    $ fg %1 (or) fg 1  # back to vim
    ^z

    $ kill 2  # raw number means pid, but pid:2 is not a child
    bash: kill: (2) - No such process

    $ kill %2
    [2]- Terminated: 15   less somefile.txt

    $ fg    # vim is only job left
    ^z

If you have a job that's taking too long and you want to **move it to the
background**, you can do `CTRL-Z` to `STOP` it, then do

    $ bg %JOB_NO

and the shell will run it as a background jobs, as though you had run it with

    $ command for background execution &
