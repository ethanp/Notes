## Glossary
* **Access controll** --- are you allowed access to the data/system?
    * You may need to acquire a *"capability"* first
* **Auditing** --- _what did you do_ while you were logged in?
* **Authentication** --- the process of verifying that "you are who you say you
  are", i.e. assuring the message's origin
* **Authorization** --- the process of verifying that "you are permitted to do
  what you're trying to do"
* **Buffer overflow** --- while writing data to a buffer, a program overruns
  the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory
    * They are the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be
      maliciously exploited
        * By e.g. overwriting the return address in a stack frame, meaning that
          execution will "return" to the attacker's address, which contains his
          data
    * Bounds checking can prevent buffer overflows
* **(Public Key/Digital) Certificate** --- an electronic document that uses a
  **digital signature** to bind a **public key** with ID info; e.g. name, org.,
  address, etc.
    * Used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual
    * If you trust the certificate, you also trust that messages signed by the
      sender’s private key were sent by that person.
    * Managed with a **public-key infrastructure** scheme
    * Issued by a **certificate authority**, a third-party trusted by both the
      owner of the certificate, and the party relying upon the certificate to
      validate the ID of the owner
    * To provide a means of determining the legitimacy of a certificate, the
      sender’s certificate is signed by someone else, whose certificate is in
      turn signed by someone else, and so on, forming a chain of trust to a
      certificate that the recipient inherently trusts, called an anchor
      certificate.
* **Challenge-Response** Authentication --- authentication involves one party
  presenting a "challenge" and the other providing a "response"
    * E.g. password authentication: "What is your password?" "It is abc$123"
    * __TODO__ learn more about this
* **Checksum** --- allow detection and repair of small number of changes
    * It's goal is similar to a hash function, but the use-case and therefore
      algorithms used are different
* **Cryptanalysis** --- the study of breaching cryptographic security systems
    * Mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms and exploiting
      weaknesses in their implementation
    * Given encrypted data, retrieve as much info as possible about the
      unencrypted data
* **Cryptographic hash function** --- takes an arbitrary block of data and
  returns a fixed-size bit string, the *cryptographic hash value*, s.t. any
  change to the data will change the hash value
* **Cryptosystem**
    1. Any computer system that involves cryptography (e.g. eMail)
    2. A suite of algorithms needed to implement a particular form of
       encryption and decryption, generally of the *asymmetric* variety, e.g.
        1. Key generation
        2. Cipher
            1. Encryption
            2. Decryption
* **Dictionary attack** --- trying a dictionary full of *likely* passwords in
  an attempt to gain unauthorized access
* **Digest** --- I believe this is the output of a **cryptographic hash
  function** such as **SHA-1**
* **[Distributed] Denial-of-Service ([D]DOS) attack** --- attempt to make a
  machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users
    * Generally consists of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or
      suspend services of a host connected to the Internet.
    * One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with
      external communications requests, so much so that it cannot respond to
      legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially
      unavailable.
* **Firewall** --- block messages based on origin, content, frequency, etc.
    * e.g. block all traffec from particular hosts or to particular TCP ports
* **Hamming weight** --- the number of symbols in a string that are different
  from the "zero" of the alphabet used
    * Equivalent to the **Hamming distance** from the all-zero string of the
      same length
    * E.g. the \\(l_{1}\\) norm of a bit vector
* **Exploit** --- a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of
  commands that takes advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in order to
  cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software,
  hardware, or something electronic.
* **Handshake** --- automated negotiation process that dynamically sets
  parameters of a communications chanel before communication begins
    * After establishing connection, before transferring desired information
    * Agreement on: (e.g.) transfer rate, coding alphabet, protocol, etc.
    * Might just say "got the message" over and over, or might say "data was
      corrupted, please resend"
* **HMAC** --- *Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code* --- a **MAC** that uses
  a **keyed hash function**
* **HTTPS** --- layers HTTP on top of **SSL/TLS**
* **Initialization vector** --- a pseudorandom number added to a message before
  encrypting to make this instance of the encryption unique
* **Integrity** --- detect accidental and intentional message changes
* **Keychain** --- apps ask this thing, via unique identifier, to open things
  with its key, so the app never actually sees the key itself
* **MAC** --- *Message Authentication Code* --- a short piece of information
  used to **authenticate** a message and to provide **integrity** and
  **authenticity** assurances on the message.
    * Often created using a **keyed (cryptographic) hash function**
        * I.e. one that accepts as input a **secret key**
* **Modular arithmetic** --- \\(a \equiv b\\) (mod \\(n\\)) **if**
  \\(((a-b)\,\%\,n == 0 \\))
    * E.g. \\(\,38 = 14 \,( \mathrm{mod}\, 12) \\) because \\((14-2)\, \% \,12
      == (38-2) \,\%\, 12 == 0 \\)
    * I guess I might summarize this operation as saying: "a and b are the same
      distance from being multiples of n"
* **Nonce** --- arbitrary (generally pseudorandom) number used only once in a
  cryptographic communication
    * E.g. used to **authenticate** users in a way that can't be reused in
      **replay attacks**
        * First you ask the server for a nonce, then you use the result to
          encrypt your **password** and send it
* **Private-key / Symmetric Cryptography** --- uses one key for both encryption
  and decryption
* **Privilege escalation** --- gain elevated access to resources that are
  normally protected from an application or user
* **Public-key / Asymmetric Cryptography** --- requires a *secret* **private
  key** and an *openly available* **public key**
    * **Public key**
        * *Encrypt plaintext*
        * *Verify* a **digital signature**
    * **Private key**
        * *Decrypt ciphertext*
        * *Create* the **digital signature**
    * Computationally infeasible to determine private key from public key
        * So public key can be published, and only those with private key may
          read the messages
* **Rainbow table attack** --- a *dictionary attack* using a precomputed table
  of reversed cryptographic hash functions
    * using a **salt** makes this attack unfeasible
* **Replay attack** --- someone catches your request to send money to someone
  else, and they just keep sending that request over and over
* **Salt** --- random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way
  function that hashes a password or passphrase
    * Protects against *dictionary* and *rainbow table* attacks
* **Secret Key** --- a piece of information that serves as a parameter to a
  cryptographic algorithm
* **Semantically secure** --- when an attacker cannot distinguish two
  encryptions from each other even if the they chose the corresponding
  plaintexts
* **Signature** --- scheme for checking **authentication** and **integrity**
* **Spoofing attack** --- one person or program successfully masquerades as
  another by falsifying data
* **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security)** ---
  cryptographic protocols designed to provide communication security over the
  Internet
    * **SSL provides an encrypted TCP connection**
    * **data integrity**
    * **endpoint authentication**
    * First they *assure the counterparty*, aka *handshake*, then they exchange
      a *symmetric key* which is then used to encrypt data sent between them
    * Often uses port 443 for **HTTPS**
    * *Uses:* eCommerce and banking
    * For more, see `Networking and Network Programming Notes.md`
* **Vulnerability** --- a *security-relevant* **software defect** that can be
  *exploited*


## Notes on Specific Things

### OAuth
##### 8/4/15

#### From Wikipedia

OAuth is an _open standard_ for _authorization_. It specifies a process for
resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources
without sharing their credentials. It is designed to be used over HTTP. It
provides _access tokens_ to third-party clients via an authorization server,
with the resource owner's approval. This access token is then used by the
client to access the protected resources in the resource server. This is the
system used when you e.g. log into some third-party website using your Google
account.

OAuth 2.0 is the most recent version. Its different implementations are not
necessarily interoperable. Its implementations have had numerous security flaws
exposed, and the protocol itself has been described by security experts as
inherently insecure.

E.g. if a user wants to access their account on an app, the app is going to ask
them for a key to their data. The user gets that key from Google and gives it
to the app, who then lets them in.

### Buffer Overflow (C[++] only, pretty much)
##### 12/8/14

This example is from the Coursera course "Software Security" video "Buffer
Overflow"

    void func(char *arg1) {
        int authenticated = 0;
        char buffer[4]; // quite small
        strcpy(buffer, str);
        if (authenticated) {
            /* do secret stuff */
        }
    }

    int main() {
        char *mystr = "AuthMe!";
        func(mystr);
    }

What happens is `mystr` is bigger than `buffer`, so it overwrites
`authenticated` to be non-zero, meaning that `if (authenticated)` is `true`,
even though the authentication didn't check-out.

#### Variants

1. Overwrite the stack-frame's saved return address to return to data that has
   been overwritten using the overflow with code to invoke the shell (via the
   `execve` system call) and give the attacker access to running what she wants
2. Overwrite the header created by `malloc`
3. Overflow the `int` passed to malloc
4. Overwrite the program's *secret key* with a known key, so that future
   encrypted messages can be decrypted
5. Modify state variables, like in the example above where `authenticated` was
   overwritten
6. Server programs might communicate with a database with SQL strings, which we
   can overwrite
7. If you don't know exactly where to jump to, you can create a `nop` sled,
   where processor will jump somewhere into your sled and slide into your code
8. "Read overflow" --- *read* instead of write beyond the buffer
    1. You ask client for both length of message and message, and you print
       chars up to that length. But if the length was longer than the message,
       then you'll print chars *beyond* the message, and they can read it.
    2. E.g. **Heartbleed**
    3. With this they can get passwords and crypto-keys
9. "Format string"

    with the code

        char *mystring = "%d %x";
        printf(mystring);

    `printf` will try to find the variables corresponding to those values off
    the stack frame, but they don't exist, so it is reading someone else's
    memory.

    The safe way to do it is like

        printf("%s", mystring);

    because now it print the string literal `"%d %x"` without trying to
    interpret it.
10. Note that you get total **memory safety** by simply *not* using C or C++

#### Protections

1. **Stack canary** --- save a number at a known location on the stack, and
   make sure it doesn't get overwritten during the function, else abort
2. Make stack (and heap) non-executable
    1. But we can still jump to code that calls `execve` *inside* `libc`, which
       is known to be in our process's address space
    2. So we can use **Address-space Layout Randomization** to make it hard to
       find `libc`
    3. But this is defeated using "gadgets" and "blind ROPs"
    4. We can defeat "blind ROPs" with "Control-flow Integrity" (which isn't
       used currently) which defines the program's "expected behavior" and
       detects deviations from that *efficiently*

### Secure coding in C[++]

1. Follow the "CERT C Coding Standard"
    1. There are similar guides for other languages
2. Use techniques like static program analysis, fuzz testing, and symbolic
   execution
3. Make sure the length the user gave you is not longer than their actual input
4. Validate input
5. Put pessimistic checks on assumed preconditions
6. Use safe versions of the string functions
    1. E.g. `strcpy(buf, "str")` becomes `strlcpy(buf, "str", sizeof(buf))`
    2. And `strcat` becomes `strlcat`
7. Don't forget about the byte added by the NUL terminator
8. Get pointer arithmetic right, e.g. (`int + 1`) adds 4 bytes
9. Don't reuse memory malloc'd before by setting `p` to `NULL` after passing it
   to `free(p)`
10. Use `goto` chains to properly free memory when you exit early from a
    function
    1. I think they did this all the time in the Linux kernel
11. Use safe libraries
    1. the Very Secure FTP string library or `std::string` which don't rely on
       null-terminators to find the length of strings
    2. Use smart pointers (standard in C++11)
    3. For networking use Google's *protocol buffers* or *Apache Thrift*
12. Use a safe allocator

### Problems on the WWW

* *Common theme:* **validate your input**

#### SQL Injection

##### The Attack

E.g. when you enter your `name` into a form as

    someone' OR 1=1); DROP TABLE mytable; --

so that PHP creates a SQL query

    SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE (name='someone' OR 1=1);
    DROP TABLE mytable;
    -- their code is commented out;

which retrieves all data then deletes it.

##### Protections

1. **Sanitize** the input --- deleting or escape characters we don't want, like
   `' ; --`
2. Stronger, **whitelist** --- make sure that it matches something that is
   valid before appending it to the query string.
3. **Limit privileges** that this instance of a connection to the database has,
   so it doesn't have the right to e.g. drop the database.
4. **Encrypt sensitive data** in the database, so when they get it they can't
   read it.

#### Session Hijacking

1. Servers send clients *cookies* which they send to the server on subsequent
   requests
2. Servers know requests with your cookies came from you, and that way you can
   access your private data on the server
3. So by stealing a cooking, an attacker can impersonate a user
4. Protect against this by sending session-cookies over HTTPS
5. Delete 'logged-in' cookies after session ends
6. Have them 'time out' anyway after some long period of time

#### Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

##### Example of Mechanism

1. A user is logged in on `bank.com`, and has appropriate session-cookies
2. The user navigates to `attacker.com/index.html`
3. `index.html` has `<img src="bank.com/transfer?amt=9999&to=attacker">`
4. The user's browser automatically issues a `GET` to the page in the `img` tag
5. So the bank sees an authenticated transfer request to the attacker and
   performs it

User could also be tricked into clicking a link for the `GET` request, e.g.
from a spam email.

##### Protections (on `bank.com`)

1. Ensure that the `GET` header's `Referer` field is within `bank.com`
2. Only respond to requests that contain a hidden form field in every link &
   form that hacker has trouble guessing (e.g. the user's session ID)

#### Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

##### Same Origin Policy (SOP)

1. Browser associates web page elements (layout, cookies, events) with a given
   *origin* (e.g. `bank.com`)
2. Only scripts received from a web-page's origin have access to that page's
   elements (layout, cookies, events)
3. XSS is a way to circumvent this

##### XSS Mechanisms

1. **Stored/Persistent XSS** --- attacker plants script to transfer them cache
   directly on the `bank.com` server
    1. This was used to take MySpace down for a weekend
2. **Reflected XSS attack**
    1. Attacker gets you to send `bank.com` its Javascript (via a URL)
    2. `bank.com` "echoes" that Javascript back to you
    3. Your browser executes the script, within the `bank.com` origin
    4. **Defense** --- `bank.com` ought to *sanitize* its responses to not
       contain `script` tags sent by the user

### Passwords

##### 5/1/14

1. [Coda Hale: How to safely store a password](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/)
2. [Security Stack Exchange: How to securely hash passwords](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords)
3. [OWASP: Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet)

#### Recurrent theme

> Don't write your own code for this stuff

#### Why bcrypt?

* It is *slow* to compute, unlike MD5, SHA-X
* *Salts* don't prevent **dictionary attacks** *(see Glossary above)* or brute
  force attacks
* It has a parameter to allow you to choose the compute requirements
* It has salts built-in to prevent **rainbow table** attacks

#### Salting

* The salt is a **128-char string**
* You save `"salt:HASH(salt+password)"` into the database
    * Note the salt is visible there as plaintext, this is OK as long as you're
      not just *giving these away*
* This means no one can use a table of pre-hashed strings to attack you
* They *can* find your salt, but then they'd have to compute all the hashes
  *for each user*

#### Some Don'ts

Paraphrased from
[stackexchange](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords)

> **Complexity is bad. Homemade is bad. New is bad.** If you remember that,
> you'll avoid 99% of problems related to password hashing, or cryptography, or
> even security in general. Do *not* write a tangled mess of operations and
> expect that to confuse attackers.

#### Some Dos

* Use as many iterations as you can tolerate on your server
* Use `/dev/urandom` to obtain salts. **Don't** use the *username*.


### Cryptographic Hash Functions

##### Hashing Vs. Encryption

**You can't un-hash, but you can *decrypt***

#### Message-Digest

* **MD5** --- *has had some problems*; produces 128-bit / 16-byte / 32-digit-
  hex hash value
    * It's not *that* secure, it seems like
* **SHA-1** --- produces 160-bit / 20-byte / 40-digit-hex
    * **Uses** --- encryption (not so secure), data integrity (e.g. Git)
* **SHA-2** --- more secure than SHA-1, really secure.

#### Other Noteworthy Algorithms

* **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) --- **symmetric** and popular within
  the U.S. government
* **Base64** -- encode into alphanumeric+2
    * The last 2 chars might be `[(+,/),(+,-),(-,_),(.,-),(_,:),(!,-), etc.]`

#### RSA
Rivest, Shamir, Adleman --- **deterministic, asymmetric** cryptosystem widely
used for secure data transmission

* *Public* encryption key, *Private* decryption key
* Based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers
* Public key --- the product of two large prime numbers and an auxiliary value
* Private key --- the two large prime numbers
* **[Operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm))**
    * Choose two *distinct* prime numbers *p* and *q* (at random, of similar
      bit-length)
    * Compute \\(n = pq\\) and \\(\Phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)\\)
    * Choose an integer \\(e\\) s.t. \\(1 < e < \Phi(n)\\), and also \\(e\\) &
      \\(\Phi(n)\\) are *coprime* (share no prime factors)
        * *e* is the *public key exponent*
        * smaller *e* will be more efficient to compute, but slightly less
          secure
    * *d* := multiplicative inverse of *e* (modulo \\(\Phi(n)\\)) [sic]
        * *d* is the *private key exponent*
    * **Encryption**:
        1. Alice sends public key \\((n, e)\\) to Bob
        2. Bob turns message \\(M\\) into an integer m s.t. \\(0 \leq m < n\\)
           using an agreed-upon reversible **padding scheme** protocol
        3. Bob computes the ciphertext \\(c \equiv {m}^{e}\\) (mod \\(n\\)) and
           transmits \\(c\\) to Alice
    * **Decryption**:
        1. Alice recovers \\(m\\) from \\(c\\) by computing \\(m \equiv {c}^{d}
           \;(\mathrm{mod} \; n\\))
        2. Now she reverses the padding scheme to recover \\(M\\) from \\(m\\)
    * **Signing Messages**: note that Bob (the public key holder) can
      **authenticate** messages Alice **signs** using her private key. This
      means that Bob can verify both that Alice sent it, and that the message
      hasn't been tampered with in the process.
        * This is *key*
* One can avoid a lot of the known methods of attack by embedding structured,
  randomized padding into the value m before encrypting it
    * Padding is very difficult, so there is a patent-expired secure padding
      scheme known as **RSA-PSS**
    * Padding schemes "are as essential for the security of message signing as
      they are for message encryption"
* Integer factorization and the RSA problem
    * For \\( \mathrm{len}(n)  \leq 300 \\), \\(n\\) can be factored in a few
      hours on a PC using free software
    * For \\( \mathrm{len}(n) \geq 2048 \\), you should be safe for a while
    * Shor's algorithm shows that a quantum computer would be able to factor in
      polynomial time, breaking RSA

## Notes about Practice

[Ref: Apple][Apple on Public, Private Keys]

Asymmetric encryption is often used for establishing a shared communication
channel. Because asymmetric encryption is computationally expensive, the two
endpoints often use asymmetric encryption to exchange a symmetric key, and then
use a much faster symmetric encryption algorithm for encrypting and decrypting
the actual data.

Asymmetric encryption can also be used to establish trust. By encrypting
information with your private key, someone else can read that information with
your public key and be certain that it was encrypted by you.

### Typical use of Public Key, and Reason it is Naive

1. Alice generate public/private key pair
2. Alice sends the public key to Bob, unencrypted
3. Alice encrypts her message (or any portion of the message) using her private
   key and sends it to Bob
4. Bob decrypts it with Alice’s public key, proving it came from Alice
5. Bob encrypts his message using Alice’s public key and sends it to Alice.
6. Alice decrypts the message with her private key.

#### Problem:
The authentication method of encrypting the message with your private key can
be got around by a man-in-the-middle attack, in which someone with malicious
intent ("Eve") replaces Alice’s original message with her own, so that Bob
Eve’s instead. Eve then intercepts & alters each of Alice’s messages. When Bob
receives the message, he decrypts it with Eve’s public key, thinking that the
key came from Alice.

### HTTPS[ecure]

> *The first step in providing secure services is using HTTP Secure (HTTPS),
> which encrypts your packets.*

#### Overview

1. Client and server exchange an *SSL certificate* in a `.crt` file ($10-300)
2. Now client *authenticates* server (using Web of Trust, scariest part of the
   process)
3. Client uses the server's public key to send him an encrypted secret
4. Server decrypts this secret using his *private* key (which *only* the
   authenticated server can do!)
5. Both the client and the server use the secret to locally generate the
   session symmetric key
6. Now they can talk safely because no one else knows their session symmetric
   key
    * However, a third party with access to the shared secret will be able to
      generate the session symmetric key and decrypt the communication.

## Cryptography

### XOR
`XOR` is represented by the symbol "\\(\oplus\\)"

Properties:
\\[x\oplus x \equiv 0\\]
\\[x\oplus 0 \equiv x\\]
Associativity & commutativity

From these we can derive that
\\[(x\oplus y)\oplus x = (x\oplus x)\oplus y = 0 \oplus y = y\\]
