## Intro to JavaFX

From [Oracle's Getting Started Tutorial][ogst]

[ogst]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm

### Features

1. Look & feel customizable with CSS
2. FXML scripting language optional for UI presentation development
3. JavaFX Scene Builder for designing UIs without writing code, generates
   editable FXML
4. Cross-platform compatibility, with consistent maintenance ensured by Oracle
5. API designed to be friendly with Scala et al.
6. Possible to integrate with JavaScript and HTML5 via WebView
7. You can embed Swing content into JavaFX applications
8. I believe the whole system was *written in vanilla Java!* (whoa)
9. Only a subset of the whole framework is actually Public API
10. It facilitates drag-and-drop and everything else you wish was easier in
    JavaScript

### Libraries & APIs

3D Graphics, Camera, Canvas for drawing directly into a scene, Printing, Rich
Text, Multitouch, Hi-DPI (nice displays), hardware-accelerated graphics, high-
performance media engine supporting web multimedia, self-contained application
deployment model, animation.

### Structure

1. The **Scene Graph** is a hierarchical tree of **Nodes** that represents all
   of the visual elements of the application's User Interface
2. Each Node of a Scene Graph besides the Root has a single *parent* and 0+
   *children*
3. Each **Scene Node** can have --- effects, blurs, shadows, opacity,
   transforms, event handles (e.g. mouse & keyboard), application-specific
   *state*
4. **Nodes** may be --- (2D & 3D), images, media, *embedded web browser* (wow),
   text, UI controls, charts, groups, containers, etc.
5. "Pulses" are events, throttled to 60 frames per second, telling the scene
   graph to synchronize with the "Prism" renderer. They are scheduled whenever
   the Scene Graph changes.


## Beginner Classes

1. Example "main class" (i.e. the one that you "run")

        public class Main extends Application {
            public static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); }
            @Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
                this.primaryStage = primaryStage;
                this.primaryStage.setTitle("p2p-gui");
                loadTheWindow();
            }
        }
2. A `Stage` is a window in your OS
3. A `Scene` is a UI element that holds content inside a window/`Stage`

## Some useful classes

1. `FXCollections.observable[Collection]([collectionInstance])` --- turns your
   existing `Collection` into an *"observable"* one on which you can install
   `Listener`s

        FXCollections.observableArrayList(/*List<T>*/ tList);

## Properties and Binding

From [Oracle's Binding Tutorial][obt]

[obt]: http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/binding/jfxpub-binding.htm

3. `interface Property` --- `getProp`, `setProp`, `addListener`,
   `removeListener`, `bind` (see ยง below)
    1. `class SimpleStringProperty` --- normal string methods, listeners, `fireValueChangedEvent`,
1. JavaFX represents object properties using the *JavaBeans component
   architecture*, which is both an API and a *design pattern*
2. **Binding** allows you to express direct relationships between variables --
   changes in one object are automatically reflected in another
3. A binding *observes* its list of *dependencies* for changes, and updates
   itself accordingly
4. A **property** is an object field that uses simple
   `getProp()`/`setProp(obj)` modifier naming conventions
5. The interfaces `Observable` (which does *not* wrap a value) and
   `ObservableValue` (which wraps a value) *fire* change notifications
6. One then *receives* change notifications in the corresponding interfaces
   `InvalidationListener` (from `Observable`) and `ChangeListener` (from
   `ObservableValue`)
7. JavaFX bindings and properties all support **lazy evaluation** (they're
   only computed when the value is *requested*) *unless* you install a
   `ChangeListener`, which forces *eager computation* because the
   `ChangeListener` has to know immediately if a change has actually occurred
    8. Normally, when any of a binding's dependencies are changed, it is
       marked `invalid`, but it is not actually recalculated until someone
       calls `getValue()`
        * You can install a listener on `invalidated()`, though note that
          *further* changes to an invalid property will *not* trigger the
          listener again

## Concurrency

[From Oracle's Concurrency Docs][ocd]

[ocd]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/interoperability-tutorial/concurrency.htm

1. Try to use `javafx.concurrent` as opposed to the standard Java `Runnable`
2. Keep the interface responsive by *backgrounding* time-consuming tasks
3. The JavaFX Scene Graph is *not thread-safe* and hence can only be accessed
   & modified from the *UI thread* called "JavaFX Application thread". You
   must keep this thread un-clogged from long tasks
4. `interface Worker` --- provides APIs for background Worker threads to
   communicate with the UI
    1. `class Task` --- fully *observable*, for doing work on a background thread
    2. `class Service` --- *executes* `Task`s (see below for more)

### Task

5. A `WorkerStateEvent` fires when a `Worker` changes **state**, both `Task`
   and `Service` can listen for these. The *worker states* are listed in the
   table below
6. `Worker` progress can be obtained via `totalWork`, `workDone`, and `progress`
7. Here's what a `Task` might look like

        Task<Integer> task = new Task<Integer>() {
            @Override protected Integer call() throws Exception {
                int iterations;
                // ...
                return iterations;
            }
        };
8. Beware: Don't try to modify the an active Scene Graph from `call()`---you
   will throw a `RuntimeException`
9. You can call `updateProgress`, `updateMessage` (this is a *property* on
   `Worker` potentially useful to the UI thread), and `updateTitle` (similar to
   `message` property) as appropriate
10. **Start** it via `task.start()` or `ExecutorService.submit(task)` (as in
    normal Java)
11. You're supposed to check `isCancelled()` every now and then and stop
    processing if `true` (as in normal Java)
12. To have a progressBar you'd call `updateProgress(...)` *inside* the
    `Task`, and then roughly the following

        new ProgressBar().progressProperty().bind(task.progressProperty());

### Service

1. `Service` facilitates interaction between background threads and the UI thread
2. So what you do is the following

        class MyService extends Service<String> {
            @Override protected Task<String> createTask() {
                return new Task<String>() {
                    @Override protected String call() {
                        return "Hello, World!";
                    }

                    // optional...
                    @Override protected void succeeded() {...}
                    @Override protected void cancelled() {...}
                    @Override protected void failed() {...}
                }
            }
        }
3. Now you can *start* the service with an `Executor` or a *daemon thread*,
   and *restart* it automatically by using a `ScheduledService` which allows a
   `backoffStrategy` and a `maximumFailureCount`

| **Worker state**  | **When** |
| ---------------:  | :------- |
| `READY`           | when just starting out                |
| `SCHEDULED`       | after being scheduled for execution   |
| `RUNNING`         | while executing                       |
| `SUCCEEDED`       | successfully completed; `value` set to *result* |
| `FAILED`          | threw exception; `exception` set to exception |
| `CANCELLED`       | if it gets inturrupted via `cancel()` |

## Scene Builder 2.0

[From an incredible tutorial](http://code.makery.ch/java/javafx-8-tutorial-part2/)

### To hook code into the view created in scene builder

1. Say in package `view` you use Scene Builder to create a view called
   `PersonOverview.fxml`
2. Now *in that same package*, create the file `PersonOverviewController.java`
3. Give all fields & methods to be accessed in the FXML file the `@FXML`
   annotation
4. The `@FXML private void initialize(){...}` method will be automatically
   called after the FXML file has been loaded, at which point the FXML fields
   should have already been *initialized* (I think *you* are responsible for
   initializing the UI elements that are *not* explicitly linked into the
   Scene Builder)
5. In the tutorial, the controller has a field

        @FXML private TableColumn<Person, String> lastNameColumn;
    This means the Table contains instances of `Person`, and this column
    renders instances of `String`, so it requires that we provide a way to map
    given `Person` instances to `String`. We may provide this in the
    `initialize()` method mentioned above via a Java 8 *lambda* expression

        lastNameColumn.setCellValueFactory(
            cellData -> cellData.getValue().lastNameProperty());
    This means (probably not *entirely* correct) that whenever we obtain a new
    `TableItem<Person>`, we should extract the `Person` instance via
    `getValue()`, and then extract the `StringProperty` called `lastName` via
    its *getter*, and use that as the `TableCell<String>`'s `value` *property*.
6. We hook the view to the controller by selecting the proper Java class from
   the dropdown in SceneBuilder under \\(Document \rightarrow Controller
   \rightarrow Controller class\\) in the left pane
7. We hook each of the UI elements into their corresponding Controller fields
   by selecting the element in the SceneBuilder element Hierarchy, going to
   \\(Code \rightarrow Identity \rightarrow fx:id\\) in the right pane and
   selecting the Controller's field name
8. To hook a `Button` in the UI up to a *handler* in the `Controller`
    1. Create the handler method

            @FXML private void handleDeletePerson() {
                int selectedIndex = personTable.getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndex();
                personTable.getItems().remove(selectedIndex);
            }
    2. Select the UI element in the SceneBuilder, and in the right-pane go to
       \\(Code \rightarrow Main \rightarrow On Action\\) and select the
       `handleDeletePerson` method from the dropdown selector

## Tables

### Cells

1. `class Control` --- a `Node` in the scene-graph which can be manipulated by
   the user
2. `class Labeled extends Control` --- a `Control` that has textual content
   associated with it (e.g. a `Button`, `Label`, or `Tooltip`)
3. `class Cell<T> extends Labeled`
    1. `T` is the type of the `Cell`'s `ObjectProperty<T> itemProperty`
    2. Used for rendering:
        1. a single "row" inside a `ListView`, `TreeView`, or `TableView`
        2. each individual "cell" inside a `TableView`
    4. Responsible for *rendering* the contained `itemProperty` (above), and
       sometimes *editing* it
    5. Could contain text, or another control such as a `CheckBox`, or any
       other UI scene `Node`, like `HBox`
    6. Extremely large data sets are actually represented using a few
       recycled `Cells` for efficiency

#### Cell Factories

from `javafx.scene.control.Cell` docs

1. `Cell` items are *rendered* by the container's skins, e.g. by default a
   `ListView` will convert it to a `String` and render that as text within a
   `Label`
2. To set how to render your type within your `Cell` within your *thingy*
   (`ListView`, `TableColumn`, `TreeView`, `TableView`, or `ListView`), you
   must provide an implementation of the `cellFactory` callback function
   defined on the *thingy* (see below example)
3. A `CellFactory` gets called when creating a new `Cell`
4. Cell factories create the `Cell` *and* configure it to react properly to
   changes in its state

##### Their Example is Pretty Good

The main thing is the last line, though I have replaced their mess with a
*lambda*. The `updateItem` method is called whenever the item in the cell
changes (e.g. goes off-screen and therefore gets re-filled with a new data
element, or [I think/hope] whenever the value in the item changes), so there
is no need to explicitly manage bindings, though you *could* if you want to.

To format a `java.lang.Number` as a *currency*, do

    class MoneyFormatCell extends ListCell<Number> {
        public MoneyFormatCell() {}
        @Override protected void updateItem(Number item, boolean empty) {
            super.updateItem(item, empty); // REQUIRED
            setText(item == null ? "" : Util.formatMy(item));
            if (item != null)
                setTextFill(isSellected() ? Color.WHITE :
                    item.doubleValue() >= 0 ? Color.BLACK : Color.RED);
        }
    }

    // The ListView tracks the known moneyList
    ObservableList<Money> moniesList = getMoniesList();
    ListView<Number> view = new ListView<>(moniesList);

    // Option 1: using lambda; value needn't be filled in constructor
    //           because it will be set using updateItem(T t, boolean e)
    view.setCellFactory(item -> return new MoneyFormatCell());

    // Option 2: define it *inline* with an *anomymously overridden*
    // `ListCell<Number>` factory-like piece of code like so
    view.setCellFactory(new Callback<ListView<<Number>, ListCell<Number>>() {
        @Override public ListCell<Number> call(final ListView<Number> p) {
            return new ListCell<Number>() {
                @Override protected void updateItem(Number e, boolean empty) {
                    super.updateItem(e, empty);
                    // update code goes here (e.g. setText("random.nextInt()"); )
    }};}});

### TreeTableView

1. A `Control` conceptually similar to `TreeView` and `TableView`
    1. Same `TreeItem` API as `TreeView` (see below)
    2. Same `TableColumn`-based approach as `TreeTableView`, using
       `TreeTableColumn`
2. The user can sort by multiple columns by holding the *shift* key while
   clicking on column headers
3. The `TreeTableView` automatically *observes* its root `TreeItem` instance
4. You can customize `class TreeTableRow<T>`, but "more often than not" [docs]
   it is easier to customize individual `Cell`s in a row rather than the `Row`
   itself.
5. `class TreeItem<T>`
    1. *not* a UI `Node`
    2. `T` is the type of the `value` property
    2. supplies a hierarchy of values to a `TreeView` or `TreeTableView`
    2. You can override `ObservableList<TreeItem<T>> getChildren()`

#### cellValueFactoryProperty

    TreeTableColumn.cellValueFactoryProperty [of type:]
        public final ObjectProperty<
            Callback<
                TreeTableColumn.CellDataFeatures<S,T>,
                OvservableValue<T>
            >
        >

##### What does that type mean?

1. `class ObjectProperty<T>` --- full implementation of a `Property<T>` (see
   above) wrapping an arbitrary object of static type `T`
2. `interface Callback<P,R>`
    1. One method: `R call(P param)`
    2. Implemented by e.g. `TreeItemPropertyValueFactory`
    3. A reusable interface for defining APIs that require a call back
3. `class TreeTableColumn.CellDataFeatures<S,T>`
    1. `S` --- `TableView` type
    2. `T` --- `TreeTableColumn` type
    3. Immutable wrapper class type to provide all necessary information
       for a particular `Cell`
4. `class TreeItemPropertyValueFactory<S,T>` is a convenience implementation
   of the `Callback` interface designed for use within the
   `TreeTableColumn.cellValueFactoryProperty`. I believe it means instead of

        firstNameCol.setCellValueFactory(
                p -> p.getValue().getValue().firstNameProperty());
    you would do

        firstNameCol.setCellValueFactory(
                new TreeItemPropertyValueFactory<Person,String>("firstName"));

    It's obviously not so useful anymore, now that there are lambdas.

## Other features

1. Multimedia support via `javafx.scene.media` APIs for video (FLV) and audio
   (MP3, AIFF, WAV)
2. Web Browser
    1. Via "Web Component", based on Webkit, provides full browser via API,
       supporting HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, and SVG, Back/Forward
       navigation, etc.
    2. Use the `WebEngine` and a `WebView`
