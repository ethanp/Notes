## What is _not_ in this set of notes
* Notes on Bash's __syntax__ can be found in __Bash Syntax Notes.md__
* Notes on __Sed and Awk__ can be found in __Sed and Awk Notes.md__
* Notes on some standard UNIX commands that I have found to be particularly
  useful can be found in __Bash Commands Notes.md__

## Handy full commands

Delete all non-pdf files recursively from directory

    find . ! -name '*.pdf' -delete

## File Descriptors

* **0** -- `STDIN`
* **1** -- `STDOUT`
* **2** -- `STDERR`

##### Examples

    make check 2>&1 | tee make-check.log

* We can think of **`2>&1`** as "point `STDERR` to where `STDOUT` points"
* `| tee afile` means "and also print it to the log-file" (in _addition_ to
  `STDOUT`)

## Settable Options

    set -o <OPTION> [-o <OPTION> ...]

* __errexit__ -- if a command doesn't return 0, `exit 1` from this script
    * This can also be accomplished with `set -e`
    * This can be disabled with `set +e`
    * If it's normal for a command to fail, append `|| true` after it so that
      the line will always return 0
* __nounset__ -- treat use of unset variables as a fatal error
    * helps avoid mistakes with e.g. `rm -rf $chroot/usr/share/doc`
    * This can also be accomplished with `set -u`
    * This can be disabled with `set +u`
* __pipefail__ -- a pipeline normally reports the exit code of its last
  command. With this option, the exit code of the pipeline is the exit code of
  the last program to return a non-zero exit code
* **set -f** -- disable filename globbing
* **shopt -s failglob** -- glob characters that get passed to a command cause
  fatal errors

## POSIX Regex Character Classes

* These can help you be international/multicultural
* They are only recognized *inside* a _square-bracket sub-expression_. So if
  you are using one of these standalone, you must wrap it in square-brackets

        [[:alnum:]]
* They only count for a single character, so for e.g. multiple spaces, you'd
  have to do

        [[:space:]]+
* What follows is likely not a complete list for *your* system because GNU
  added more, etc.

#### But here are the basics

| **Class**   | **Matches**   |
|  -------:   | :----------   |
| `[:alnum:]` | alphanumeric  |
| `[:alpha:]` | alphabetic    |
| `[:blank:]` | space & tab   |
| `[:cntrl:]` | control chars |
| `[:digit:]` | numeric       |
| `[:graph:]` | non-space     |
| `[:lower:]` | lowercase     |
| `[:print:]` | printable     |
| `[:punct:]` | punctuation   |
| `[:space:]` | whitespace    |
| `[:upper:]` | uppercase     |
| `[:xdigit:]`| hexadecimal   |

## Things one may want to do

### Repeat a command *N* times

Version with cleanest syntax

    for i in {1..10}; do command; done

Version is more flexible because you can go by 3's etc. (see `seq` command
below)

    for i in `seq 10`; do command; done

### Iterate through files

    find . -name '*.csv' | while read line; do
        echo "$line"
    done

## Some crazed bash commands

### Coursera Lecture Time Aggregator

In a folder containing a bunch of videos with titles of the format *"Compilers
3.0 04-01 Lexical Specification (14m30s).mp4"*, I'd like to count the total
number of hours of video.

Algo

1. Morph list of filenames into just the time-pieces, e.g. 6m29
2. Split those strings on `m`
3. Add up the hours and minutes separately
4. Add up the total number of minutes and divide it into hours
5. Print it out

```bash
$ ls \
  | sed 's/[^(]*(\([^s]*\)s).*/\1/' \
  | awk -Fm '{s+=$1;t+=$2} END {printf "%.2f hrs\n", (t/60+s)/60}'

#=> 19.50 hrs
```

### Bootleg Spellchecker

August 11, 2015

Look for spelling errors in some crappy Mac-provided dictionary file. Based on
the UNIX command given in the [AT&T Archives Video][arch], but many of the
commands have disappeared since then and new ones have been introduced.

[arch]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0

```bash
$ echo "The quick brown Fox jumped over." \
  | tr ' ' '\n' \                     # replace spaces with newlines
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \      # convert to lowercase
  | sed 's|[^[:alpha:]\n]||g' \       # only keep letters
  | sort -u \                         # sort and dedup
  | comm -23 - /usr/share/dict/words  # keep only words not found in dictionary

=> jumped
```
