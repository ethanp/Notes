Many notes are from *C++ the Core Language*, by Gregory Satir & Doug Brown.

## Not Specific to Classes

### Overloading

* C++ allows more than one function with the same name as long as their signatures [set of parameters in the definition] differ
    * **This is unlike C**.
* They *can**not*** *just* differ in their **return** types

### I/O

#### Print using cout

    #include <iostream.h>
    std::cout << (<output>);
    std::cout << myInt;
    std::cout << myFloat;
    std::cout << "a string\n";
    std::cout << "sqrt: " << sqrt(myInt) << std::endl;
    
    // print to standard error
    std::cerr << "negative number passed\n";


#### How to make this work for your custom class

Make this work for your own class by writing the following (*outside* of the
`class` definition). Don't include the backslash. Without the backslash the
multimarkdown compiler pukes.

    std::ostream & operator<<\(std::ostream & Str, Object const & v) { 
      // print something from v to str, e.g: Str << v.getX();
      return Str;
    }

Ref: [stove](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5171739/tostring-override-in-c)

### Default parameters

The following can be called with *or* without 3rd parameter '`t`'.

    int fctn(int p1, int p2, char t='n')

### new & delete for malloc & free

* Single float
    
        // C
        float *fp = malloc(sizeof(float));
        free(fp);
        
        // C++
        float *fp = new float;
        delete fp;

* Float array        
    
        // C
        float *fa = malloc(sizeof(float) * 10);
        free(fa);
        
        // C++
        float *fa = new float[10];
        delete[] fa;
        
* Class instance

        Bar *bp = new Bar;
        delete bp;

### "References"

Declaration

    // C
    void plus_5(int *ip) {
      *ip = *ip + 5;
    }
    
    // C++
    void plus_5(int &ip) { // note the inclusion of an ampersand
      ip = ip + 5; // no asterix, even though this is NOT a local variable 
    }

Usage

    // C
    int n = 3;
    plus_5(&n);
    
    // C++
    int n = 3;
    plus_5(n);  // no &amp

### Const
**Makes a value/pointer un-modify-able** (to help you reason about it)

#### Refs:
1. [stove](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/455518/)

### Casting
* You are free to cast between _any_ two types
* Some types are implicitly casted to other types (e.g. `int -> long`) when necessary
* Like C, you can *implicitly* cast **to** a `void *`

        void *v;
        Foo *f;
        v = f;

* **Unlike C**, you must *explictly* cast **from** a `void *`

        void *v;
        Foo *f;
        f = (Foo *)v;


### Globals

* **Unlike C**, you *can* use a *dynamic* expression to initialize a
  *global* variable
    
        int global1 = my_func();
        int global2 = 2 * global1;
    
        main() { ... }

* These are dynamically **initialized *before* `main()` is entered**.
* This can lead to nasty bugs when linking against other files, so
  be-keahfo.

### Some keywords

* **volatile** --- does "less optimizations", for when a variable might
  be used by another thread or a memory-mapped device or something. (I
  don't actually understand this)
* **inline** --- *hint* to the compiler that the function should be
  expanded in-place "like a macro"
    * More "powerful" than macros because inlining is performed by the
      compiler rather than the preprocessor
        * Although I don't know what 'power' _is_ in that context

## Classes
 
#### Class vs Struct

The _default_ access level for classes is `private`, and for structs is
`public`. Other than that there is _no_ difference. One could believe the main
difference is one of humano-cognitive perceptual semantics.

### Basic Class Example

    class Stack {

    public:
      void push(int i);
      int pop();
      Stack();   // instead of init(Stack *s) in C
      ~Stack();  // instead of cleanup(Stack *s) in C
    
    private:
      int items[STACKSIZE];
      int top;

    };
    
### Constructors & Destroyers

* Functions like `ABC()` and `~ABC()` get the compiler to handle object initialization and cleanup for you.
* The **constructor** is called when an object of `class ABC` is *declared*
    * Can be overloaded just like any other function
    * Doesn't have a `return` type
* The **destructor** is called when the object *leaves scope*

#### Copy constructor

    ABC(ABC &copy_from_me);

Note, the declaration/definition does __not__ state a return type.

Allows you to say (not sure this is correct)

    ABC a2;
    ABC a1 = a2;

Now `a1` has the same __value(s)__ as `a2`, but does _not_ point to the same
block of memory.

### "Member functions" (i.e. methods)

They can be defined *inside* or *outside* the class definition

    class ABC {
    public:
    
      void definedInside(int i) {
        cout << i + 1;
      }
      
      void definedOutside(int i);
    }
    
    void ABC::definedOutside(int i) {
      cout << i + 2;
    }
    
    
### Access Modifiers/Levels


* **public** --- can be accessed by any code
* **protected** --- can be accessed within subclasses only
* **private** --- can only be accessed by the classâ€™s own member functions
  (and *"friends"*)
* One object ***can*** access the `private` members of another object
  from the same `class`, but **can _not_** access `private` members of
  the `class` it subclasses.

#### Member variables

##### static

Only one copy of the data is maintained for all objects of the class
(just like Java)


### Inheritance ("derived classes")

#### Access levels

* You define it right before you say which class you are deriving from.
* The *default* is `private`

        class A 
        {
        public:
            int x;
        protected:
            int y;
        private:
            int z;
        };

        class B : public A
        {
            // x is public
            // y is protected
            // z is not accessible from B
        };

        class C : protected A
        {
            // x is protected
            // y is protected
            // z is not accessible from C
        };

        class D : private A    // 'private' is default for classes
        {
            // x is private
            // y is private
            // z is not accessible from D
        };
        
    ([ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/860339))

### Overloading operators

* E.g. the `assignment operator`

        // in class declaration
        void operator=(ABC &other); 
        
        // then we define
        void ABC::operator=(ABC &other) { /* code */ }


### Virtual Functions
* **Virtual functions** behave according to the *run-time* type of
  the object they are called on
    1. Declare a pointer to the *base* class `ABC`
    2. Point it to an instance of the *derived* class `DEF`
    3. Call the *virtual* function, it will call the version as defined
       on the *derived* class `DEF::virtualFunction()`
* **Non-virtual functions** behave according to the *static* type
  of the object they are called on
* The **syntax** is like so

        virtual void virtualFunction();
        
    * The **syntax is *required*** in the *declaration* in the
      *base class* `ABC`
    * The **syntax is *optional*** in the *derived class* `DEF`
