## Just a list of them at this point

Much of this list is from **An introduction to Object-Oriented Programming**
(3rd ed.) by *Timothy Budd*.

1. **Adaptor** --- a *client* object needs a *service* but requires a specific
   *interface*, a *server* object provides the *functionality*, but *doesnâ€™t
   support* the right interface; instead of rewriting either client or server,
   create an adapter who **translates the results of the service provider into
   the language of the client**.

2. **Iterator** --- Reduces info client must know to access elements of a
   collection, it simply provides the interface (`bool hasMore()`, `Obj nextElem()`)

3. **Factory** --- e.g. the `Iterator iterator()` method of a class returns an
   `iterator` that knows how to iterate through elements of `this`
   `Collection`, but all we care about is that it implements the `Iterator`
   interface. So the `iterator()` method is a `Factory` that returns an object
   whose interface we care about, but whose implementation matches what we
   want to *do*, but we don't care *how* it manages to do so.

4. **Strategy** --- the client always wants to do the same thing (e.g. layout
   a grid, perform regression, assess a situation) and when it does that it
   assumes there is a special function to make it happen (e.g. layout(),
   regress(), assess()) but it wants to use a different *strategy* at
   different times, so there are a bunch of `Strategy` objects that implement
   the different strategies but provide the same interface for use.

5. **Singleton** --- Ensures that there will never be more than one instance
   of the class created.

6. **Composite** --- permit creation of complex objects using simple parts by
   allowing simple *components* to be nested arbitrarily. Like how
   `ViewControllers` and `Views` nest inside each other.

7. **Decorator** (aka *filter* or *wrapper*) --- for adding new functionality
   to objects; an alternative to inheritance. It *has-an* instance of the
   class it wrapps, but also adds new methods that it can pass to that
   instance. Or something. Didn't quite get it.

8. **Double-Dispatch** --- say that two *polymorphic variables*, `Shape` &
   `Device` need to be able to talk to each other. So we use this particular
   way of writing a method on each shape to respond to each device.

        def Printer.display(Shape shape)
          shape.displayOnPrinter(self) # Note "self" is a Printer
        end

        def Terminal.display(Shape shape)
          shape.displayOnTerminal(self)
        end

    Now we must add

        def Triangle.displayOnPrinter(Printer p)
          # code #
        end

        def Triangle.displayOnTerminal(Terminal t)
          # code #
        end

9. **Flyweight** --- share state in common between similar objects to reduce
   aggregate required storage. If each instance of a class points to the same
   data, then don't duplicate it in each object, instead create an instance of
   type `Class` and each instance of `MyClass` points to the info in the
   instance of `Class`. These `Class` objects are called *flyweights*.

10. **Proxy** --- similar to the *Adaptor* pattern. E.g. hide details of
    transmission protocols when communicating over a network to remote
    objects. Doesn't actually do much work, just changes the interface to make
    it more uniform (across e.g. protocols).

11. **Facade** --- Similar to the *Proxy* pattern, but where the *actual* work
    is done by a collection of *interacting* objects, rather than a single
    object. So the *facade* is the *intermediary* or *focal point* who hands
    off requests to the appropriate handler. This way we needn't even
    *remember* which object is meant to handle a particular thing. (This
    sounds like an excellent idea.)

12. **Observer** --- keep two objects synchronized with each other without
    direct knowledge of each other, e.g. if one is dynamically created &
    destroyed during execution (e.g. a view wrt a model). So we create an
    intermediary `ObserverManager` who communicates with the `model` and the
    `observers` who maintain lists of who they're observing, and the `view`
    can add itself to this list.
