## MOM -- Message Oriented Middleware

* Using __asynchronous message passing__ instead of _request-response_
  architectures allow us to achieve greater __decoupling__ between our program
  _components_
* To achieve the highest level of decoupling, we need an independent "receive"
  queue to buffer messages sent when the receiver or the network is down (e.g.
  Kafka and RabbitMQ)
    * If this is going to get really big (e.g. because the message volume is
      high and the receiver is unavailable for a long time) then it should
      spill to disk when it gets too big to efficiently hold in memory
* To achieve the highest speeds (but increased coupling), we should send
  _directly_ to the reciever (e.g. ZeroMQ can even do this via a UNIX-style
  "named pipe" instead of using the TCP stack infrastructure)
* Some MOMs provide an API to internal routing logic so that the MOM itself
  decides which receiver queue to place an incoming message on, instead of the
  sender deciding

### Feature Set of MOMs

* __Durability__ -- whether buffered messages can be written to disk or DBMS so
  that they survive crashes
* __Subscription Models__
    * __Point-to-Point__ -- one sender, one receiver
    * __Publish-Subscribe__ -- senders send to a "topic", and receivers
      _subscribe_ to new messages posted to that topic
* __Push or Pull__ -- whether consumers pull messages destined for them, or the
  broker sends the message through an open connection when it receives it from
  the sender
* __Message acknowledgement__ -- this helps with reliability of message
  delivery
* __Delivery policies__ -- e.g. at-_least_-once, at-_most_-once, _exactly_ once
* __Purging policies__ -- when does the broker delete messages; could be 
    * after they are consumed/ACKd,
    * once the queue gets to a certain size
    * after a certain amount of time
* Supported __message size, format, and throughput__ -- they may support XML or
  JSON or some binary thing, up to 20MB, up to 100K/sec etc.
* __Routing policies__ -- whether the broker itself can filter messages for
  particular consumers so that the consumer only receives the exact subset of
  messages it is interested. Of course this logic can always be done by the
  producer and consumer themselves as well, but that might be more headache and
  lower performance.
* __Message ordering__ -- e.g. FIFO, or per-partition FIFO (e.g. Kafka), or no
  guarantees
* __Batching policies__ -- e.g. wait to send messages in bulk until time limit,
  size limit, or message count
* __Scalability__ -- if I just throw more machines at the system, how can I
  expect system performance to change?
* __Availability__ -- what parts of the system will still be functional in
  cases of different sorts of (e.g. network or hardware) failures
    * E.g. if the lead Kafka broker for a partition fails, another broker will
      become leader and take over
        * in general, though it can be configured that this new lead broker
          _must_ be in the In-Sync Replicas set or whatever
* __Operational and financial overhead__ -- how many compute/memory resources
  do we need, how long do we need to spend configuring, maintaining,
  reconfiguring over time, etc.
* __Cross platform interoperability__ -- e.g. runs on Windows (why?)

### Alternative: Use a database as a queue

* Put messages into the database to "send"
* Get/poll (possibly also delete/update) messages from the database to
  "receive"
* This is __not__ what databases were designed to do efficiently
    * So it's not going to _scale_ well
* All in all, you could probably bend this solution to have whatever of the
  above attributes you want, but again, that's not what typical modern
  databases were designed to do




## AMQP -- Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

* AMQP is a binary, application layer protocol, designed to efficiently support
  a wide variety of messaging applications and communication patterns
* It does _not_ define a standard API; it _only_ defines the the wire protocol
* Before AMQP, it was [even] more difficult to build applications that combine
  platforms, protocols, and patterns (e.g. using JMS, which only has good
  support for Java)
* It provides flow controlled, message-oriented communication with various
  optional message- delivery guarantees
* It assumes an underlying reliable transport layer protocol such as TCP
* AMQP was originated in 2003 by John O'Hara at JPMorgan Chase in London, UK
    * The working group grew to 23 companies by 2011
* Transfers are subject to a credit based flow control scheme, managed using
  "`flow`" frames. This allows a process to protect itself from being
  overwhelmed by too large a volume of messages
* Each transferred message must eventually be settled. Settlement ensures that
  the sender and receiver agree on the state of the transfer, providing
  reliability guarantees
* Changes in state and settlement for a transfer (or set of transfers) are
  communicated between the peers using the disposition frame
* The various standard reliability guarantees e.g. "(at-(least|most)|_exactly_)
  once" can be enforced this way
* A session is a bidirectional, sequential conversation between two peers that
  is initiated with a begin frame and terminated with an end frame
* A connection between two peers can have multiple sessions multiplexed over
  it, each logically independent
* Connections are initiated with an open frame in which the sending peer's
  capabilities are expressed, and terminated with a close frame
* Message headers may include time to live, durability, and priority info
* Messages may include a `Map` of __attributes__ (meta-data) that the broker or
  consumer can use however you want
* Messages received by the consumer _may_ be ACKed so that the broker knows
  that it can be removed from the queue
* You can decide what to do when a broker is not able to deliver a message to
  its intended recipients, e.g.
    * Drop it entirely
    * Place the message in a special _"dead letters queue"_ for consumption by
      a separate consumer
    * Return it to the publisher

### Basic architectural components

* __Publisher/producer__ -- publishes messages to _brokers_
* __Broker__ -- contains an _exchange_ and the _queues_
* __Exchange__ -- decides how to put messages received into _queues_ using
  _bindings_
    * __Types__
        * Direct
        * Fanout
        * Topic
        * Headers/match
    * __Attributes__
        * Name
        * Durability (_durable_ or _transient_) -- whether msgs survive broker
          restart
        * Auto-delete -- whether msgs are deleted after delivered as-intended
        * Arguments -- other attributes, specific to the exchange used
* __Binding__ -- a rule about how messages should be added to a queue
* __Queue__ -- a buffer from which consumers consume
* __Consumer__ -- may *either* __pull *or* get pushed__ messages from _queues_

## RabbitMQ

* When using __auto-acknowledgement__, the consumer ACKs messages it receives,
  which tells the broker that it has the to delete them from the queue

### RabbitMQ vs Kafka

* Use Rabbit if you have messages (20k+/sec) that need to be routed in complex
  ways to consumers, you want per-message delivery guarantees, you don't care
  about ordered delivery, and/or you need HA at the cluster-node level now
* RabbitMQ is broker-centric, focused around delivery guarantees between
  producers and consumers, with transient preferred over durable messages
* RabbitMQ uses the broker itself to maintain state of what's consumed (via
  message acknowledgements) - it uses Erlang's Mnesia to maintain delivery
  state around the broker cluster
* Unlike Kafka, RabbitMQ presumes that consumers are mostly online, and any
  messages "in wait" (persistent or not) are held opaquely (i.e. no cursor)
* RabbitMQ pre-2.0 (2010) would even fall over if your consumers were too
  slow, but now it's robust for online and batch consumers - but clearly large
  amounts of persistent messages sitting in the broker was not the main design
  case for AMQP in general
* The AMQP 0.9.1 model says "one producer channel, one exchange, one queue, one
  consumer channel" is required for in-order delivery
* The whole job of Kafka is to provide the "shock absorber" between the flood
  of events and those who want to consume them in their own way
* Kafka currently blows away RabbitMQ in terms of performance on synthetic
  benchmarks
* Kafka is an early Apache incubator project
* It doesn't necessarily have all the hard-learned aspects in RabbitMQ
* The AMQP standard is 'a mess'
* RabbitMQ offers optional durability and persistence (two separate features)
* The persistence uses an optimized logging format that provides the fastest
  possible write throughput (similar to things that Redis and Riak are doing)
* You never have to touch the persistent message store, and in the majority of
  cases, RabbitMQ will never read the persistent store
    * It is just there for insurance in the case of server crash or a low
      memory situation
* Kafka's "partitions" feature allows you to dynamically adjust the number of
  consumers concurrently reading a topic. Basically you just add a new consumer
  of a topic to an existing consumer group, and Kafka will "rebalance"
  automatically so that the responsibility of reading partiticular partitions
  within that topic is shared well amongst the consumers in the group. Of
  course this is only useful in those rare cases that you are building a system
  to dynamically deal with a rising message influx and overload. I'm not sure,
  but I kind of doubt RabbitMQ lets you handle that case so effectively.
