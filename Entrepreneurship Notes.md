## Lean Startup: Eric Ries

### Introduction

1. He has seen his own and many others' startups fail
2. He has learned from his own and many others' successes
3. Coming from a software background, he used to think technical issues were
   the cause of failures, but has changed his mind
    * startups require the ability to figure out what the company wants and
      quickly position the company to be able to persue that goal as its
      mission
4. He's building on
    1. lean manufacturing (Toyota) -- "completely new way of thinking about the
       manufacturing of physical goods"
    2. design thinking
    3. customer developemnt (Steve Blank) -- "the business and marketing
       functions of a startup should be considered as important as engineering
       and product development and therefore deserve an equally rigorous
       methodology to guide them."
    4. agile development
5. His first (moderately) successful startup was "characterized by an extremely
   fast cycle time, a focus on what customers want (without asking them), and a
   scientific approach to making decisions."
6. At first, no one believed in Eric or his ideas
7. Eventually it blossomed into a global movement
8. So that movement has become his exclusive focus

#### The Lean startup method

1. __Entrepreneurs are everywhere__ -- it's anyone involved in a _startup_
    * __definition of a startup__: a human institution designed to create _new
      products and services_ under conditions of _extreme uncertainty_
2. __Entrepreneurship is management__ -- so it better be geared to its context
   of extreme uncertainty
3. __Validated learning__ -- "frequent experiments allow entrepreneurs to test
   each element of their vision"
4. __Build-measure-learn__ -- this is the fundamental accelerated _feedback
   loop_ required of a successful startup
5. __Innovation accounting__ -- focuses on
    1. Measuring progress
    2. Setting up milestones
    3. Prioritizing work
6. "Startups do not yet know who their customer is or what their product should
   be." So a good plan, solid strategy, and thorough market research isn't
   going to cut it.



### Part One: VISION

#### Chapter 1: START

> Many entrepreneurs take a 'just do it' attitude, avoiding all forms of
> management, process, and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to
> chaos more often than it does to success. I should know: my first startup
> failures were all of this kind.
