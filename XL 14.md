## Usage notes

### Running tests

    bundle exec rspec spec/
    bundle exec rspec spec/requests/user_pages_spec.rb
    bundle exec rspec spec/requests/user_pages_spec.rb -e "signup page"
    
### Heroku

    git push heroku
    heroku run rake db:migrate
    
    heroku open
    heroku logs
    heroku run console


## Goals

1. Have a way to track how my time is spent
2. "Trick" myself into working harder
3. Not waste time doing useless things

## Motivation

1. Last time I tried this, it was *enormously **successful** as a **motivator***

## Must haves

1. A list of tasks with due dates
2. Recurring tasks
3. Priority levels
4. Input intervals at which a task was worked on

## Imaginings

1. You have a list of categories
    * Which you can add to at will (subtracting sounds dangerous)
2. You click on a category
3. You have a list of tasks or events within that category
    1. The *Life* category might have tasks like Sleeping, Chilling, Partying, Exercising
        * These don't have due dates, but do have time intervals at which they were performed
    2. The *Advanced OSs* category might have tasks like "Assignment 1"
        * Sometimes subtasks are just distracting, but for an item like "Midterm", it *would* be helpful to have subtasks
    3. A Task might have a
        1. due date
        2. priority
        3. expected amount of time left
        4. time spent so far
        5. box for inputting time intervals spent
3. The *Misc Learning* task might have
    * useful youtube videos that I've watched
    * tutorials I read
    * perhaps they could be rated by *how* useful they actually were
4. Some sort of summary page, with
    1. pie charts
    2. trend graphs
    3. colors about good or bad
    4. *calendar heat map!*
5. While a time interval is being recorded, it reminds you to take a break every now and again
6. As a way of entering in a time interval, I'd like it if you could just add the start time as, say `1134 tonight/this morning/last night`, and then instead of entering in the end time, say `time spent = 45`
7. As a way of entering in a lot of data, one could add a CSV file uploader like the one in the youtube video *How to Build a CSV Uploader into a Ruby on Rails Application*. It takes like 3 minutes.
8. Also the *How to Build a CSV Downloader for a Ruby on Rails Application* takes another 3 minutes. Another little nice-to-have.
9. Integrate with FitBit to incorporate its own heatmap, and automatically collect the sleep data?
    1. That actually sounds pretty attractive


## Missing Schema elements

### User

1. (eventually) *has many* **aggregated statistics** (these will probably just be methods)
2. (eventually) *has many* **overarching goals**
3. (eventually) *has many* **inspiring quotes**
4. (eventually) *has an* **icon**


## Vision v2

### Beware

1. **Don't track things that needn't be tracked** --- e.g. food spending: it *just doesn't matter*
2. **Track things I want to hold myself accountable for** --- e.g. wake-up time and time spent exercising
3. **Don't implement things that aren't strictly necessary** until everything necessary is there

### User homepage

It's all a giant Bootstrap 3 Jumbotron

### After it *works*

1. Add a simple github-esque calendar heat map with d3.js, there's examples everywhere

### Over time

1. Do awesome charting with dc.js ("Dimensional Charting in Javascript")
    * I saved a bunch of articles for help figuring out how to use it
    * It's basically exactly what I need, and *certainly* good to know
